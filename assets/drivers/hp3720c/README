  `- rr37xx_8xx_28xx_linux_src_vx.x.x_xx_xx_xx.bin : driver for RocketRAID controller

#############################################################################
3. Installation
#############################################################################

  1)  Extract the source package to a temporary directory.

  2)  Change to the temporary directory.

  3)  Run the .bin file to install the driver package, 
      then the driver will be loaded automatically after reboot.

    # sh rr37xx_8xx_28xx_linux_src_vx.x.x_xx_xx_xx.bin

  NOTES:

    The installer requires super user's permission to run the installation.
  So if you are not logged in as root, please supply the password of root to
  start the installation.

    The installer will check and install build tools if some of them is missing.
  A network connection is required to install the build tools. And on debian
  system, the original installation medium may be required if the packages not
  configured to be installed from Internet. The following tools are checked by the
  installer:

    gcc
    make
    perl

    They are installed automatically when you select "Software Development
  Workstation" group in the installation of RHEL/CentOS 6.

    When packages are installed from network, it may take too long to complete
  the installation as it depends on the network speed. The packages could be
  installed first to omit the network issue by following command:

    # yum install gcc make perl

    If the installer failed to find or install the required build tools, the
  installation will be terminated without any change to the system.

    The installer will install folders and files to /usr/share/hptdrv/rr3740a.

    At the end of the installation, the installer will build driver module
  rr3740a for all kernels in the system.

    And the auto build script will be invoked to build driver module for
  kernels added automatically when system reboot or shutdown.

  Notice:

    The instructions above are all about installing the driver automatically. If you want to
  compile and load driver manually, the following instructions are ready for you.	 

    Decompress .bin file to get an open source code directory by following command:

    # ./rr37xx_8xx_28xx_linux_src_vx.x.x_xx_xx_xx.bin --noexec --target rr3740a
					 
    Enter to directory rr272x and compile source code to get a module by following commands:

    # cd rr3740a/product/rr3740a/linux/

    # make

    Load the rr3740a.ko by executing the following command:

    # insmod rr3740a.ko
    
    Remove the rr3740a.ko by executing the following command:

    # rmmod rr3740a.ko
